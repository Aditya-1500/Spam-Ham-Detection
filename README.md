# Tweet Spam-Ham-Detection
This is an ensemble based spam detection web-application that uses probablistic data-structures based on the paper: A. Singh, S. Batra, Ensemble based spam detection in social IoT using probabilistic data structures, Future Generation Computer Systems (2017), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2017.09.072.

## Features of the Project

### Users can:
1. Test whether a tweet is spam or ham using the ensemble based spam detection classifier.
2. Type/Paste a single tweet or upload a file to test multiple tweets.
3. Sign-up to create an account and add custom files as database for the classifier model.
4. Login and add/update files from their profile.
5. Classify tweet(s) using model trained from their custom files (Login Required).

### The ensemble-based spam detection classifier uses the following models:
1. Quotient filter to quickly and efficiently search the parts of tweet from a list of spam urls, spam users and spam words stored in database.
2. Locally sensitive hashing using MinHash is used to get the jaccard similarity of the input tweet from a set of ham and spam tweets in the database.
3. A Machine Learning model trained on a large dataset of spam and ham tweets. The model uses a pipeline where the tweet goes through CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer and then using Multinomial Naive Bayes from sklearn library, the model gives the prediction.
